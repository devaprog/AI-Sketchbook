# ðŸŽ¨ AI-Sketchbook

A repository containing my single-file code projects, scripts, and experiments created during the learning phase of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning.

This "sketchbook" serves as a chronological journal of concepts I've explored, with each code file representing a standalone "page."

### **[Page-1] Sigmoid Function Visualizer with Pygame**

**File:** `sigmoid_visualizer.py`

**Goal:** To gain an intuitive understanding of how the Sigmoid function maps any real-valued number to a value between 0 and 1, which is crucial for binary classification and hidden layer activation in neural networks.

**Dependencies:**
* `pygame`
* `numpy`

**How to Run:**
1.  Ensure you have the dependencies installed (`pip install pygame numpy`).
2.  Run the script: `python sigmoid_visualizer.py`
3.  *Interaction:* Move the mouse horizontally to see the output of the Sigmoid function change in real-time.
